If you have fifteen minutes every weekday and a couple of hours on the weekend, you can learn to code.
You'll gain a deeper understanding software than most bootcamps ever touch on, and you don't need any more knowledge than what you used to get to this webpage.

If that sounds good to you, [get started for free now](/ced/listen).

## How it works

1. For fifteen minutes every weekday, [listen to a lesson](/ced/listen)
2. Each weekend, do [that week's exercise](/ced/exercises)

That's it.

### Wait, really?

Yep.
You do need to participate -- really listen to the episodes, think about them, and do the episodes -- but that's really it.

## Supporting the show

If you appreciate my work, you can [send me a few dollars](/ced/donate).

Every little bit helps me afford a better recording setup, pay audio editors, and so on.
You can also get some benefits if you pay enough, like having your name listed right here.
No one's doing that yet, though.
