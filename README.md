# Code Every Day

Code Every Day (CED) is a podcast for the average person to learn the most basic ways how computer programs work.
It teaches the skills you need to become a software developer, malware analyst, software tester, or more.

More specifically, this course is broken into weeks.
Each week has:
- An introduction to the week's concepts on Monday
- Details and more explanation on Tuesday through Friday
- An exercise to practice on Saturday or Sunday

You'll need to:
- Speak English pretty well, though you don't need to know tech jargon
- Have a fairly modern browser, like the ones on most smartphones or your local library's computers
- Participate in learning, by thinking about the lectures and actually doing the exercises

New episodes are released a week's worth at a time.
The release schedule is irregular, because each set of episodes takes a different amount of time to do, but the goal is to release a batch every two or three months.

Find the podcast anywhere you find podcasts.

## This repository

This repo is the monolith that contains almost everything about Code Every Day.
Specifically, it has:

- The direct source for the CED site (which is hosted on GitHub Pages directly from here)
- The code that runs the exercise platform
- The blog entries, which are also hosted on the website
- Each week's scripts
- The overall outline for the whole series

Unfortunately, the audio files can't be stored on GitHub -- small as audio files are, compared to videos, they're still too big to host on GitHub.

## Requesting changes

There are two kinds of changes you might want to request.

- There's something objectively wrong that has to be corrected.
  For example, an exercise solution doesn't work, or one of the scripts doesn't match the episode.

  That's called a **bug report**.

- You think things could be better, but they're not strictly *wrong* as they are.
  Maybe you have an idea for a better metaphor, or a way to simplify the language used.

  That's called a **feature request**.

Once you've decided which category your change is in, you can report it:

- [On GitHub](https://github.com/nic-hartley/ced/issues/new/choose), if you have an account
- By email, eventually, once I set up a dedicated CED email address
